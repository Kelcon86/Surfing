## Overview:
Analysis was performed to get information about temperature trends before opening a surf shop in Oahu. Specifically, we wanted temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if a surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results:
- As shown below June's minimum temperature is 64° and the maximum temperature is 85°.
- The mean temperature for June is 75°.

## Summary:
We were able to determine that the average temperatures in Oahu were 75° (in June) and 71° (in December). The maximum temperature for both months was 85°. December had a slightly cooler minimum temperature at 56° compared to Junes minimum of 64°. Overall, the temperature analysis shows that Oahu is a good location for a surf and ice cream shop.

Since there is more to weather than just temperature though, additional queries to analyze precipitation, cloudiness and wind speed should be performed. All of these are also important factors in determining if a surf and ice cream shop would be sustainable year-round.
